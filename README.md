# dotfiles

I manage my dotfiles with the help of a git bare repository, as it is super simple to track and update dotfiles, without having to, for example, create symlinks to every single dotfile. My inspiration for this technique came from [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tBoLDpTWVOM) by DistoTube on YouTube.

## Set-by-step guide how to configure the dotfile repository

**Step 1:** Create and initialize a git bare repository named `dotfiles` in your `$HOME` directory with a `master` branch.

```bash
mkdir $HOME/dotfiles && git init --bare --initial-branch=master $HOME/dotfiles
```

**Step 2:** Add an alias called `dotfiles` to your `.bashrc` for managing the dotfiles repository.

```bash
echo "alias dotfiles='/usr/bin/git --git-dir=$HOME/dotfiles --work-tree=$HOME'" >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

**Step 3:** Configure the dotfiles repository to not show any file or folder, unless tracked specifically by you.

```bash
dotfiles config --local status.showUntrackedFiles no
```

**Step 4:** Add the remote called `origin` pointing to the dotfiles repositry on `GitHub`, to be able to share your dotfiles.

```bash
dotfiles remote add origin <url>
```

**Step 5:** Fetch everything from the remote repository on GitHub and set the master branch to track the remote.

```bash
dotfiles fetch origin master && dotfiles branch --set-upstream-to=origin/master master
```
